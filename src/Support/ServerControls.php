 * The component itself is Livewire\ServerControls; this is the setting, the
 * decision about which pages get it, and the one render hook that puts it
 * there.
 *
 * PAGE_START rather than the topbar: it is the hook Pelican itself renders a
 * Livewire component into, so it is known to work in this panel, and it is
 * above the page's own heading on every page including the ones whose header
 * has no actions of its own. It also survives the theme's own layouts - a
 * hidden topbar or a folded sidebar moves the shell, not the page.
